A serial fiend, "Goé" first learnt his trade as a teenager in the feudal era of the official Premier League Fantasy Football website, devising and manually processing obscenely complicated head-to-head Champions League and FA Cup tournaments. He fell out of love with the game after a deluge of mediocre performances, with the well-known monotonous churn of the peasant format taking its toll. While in exile in the People's Republic of China, Goé started work on a business plan to bring "draft" fantasy football to the world. Unfortunately, progress stalled after he enlisted future rival manager Dan Barber ("Barbs") as chief operating officer and Barbs's time in China was mostly wasted chugging unceremoniously on a Vietnamese tobacco pipe. Months later, Goé was amazed to find a new draft website that had put all their ideas into being and it wasn't long before an army of fiends were signed up and the league and the (rumour) mill were formed.

In terms of management style, Goé is known to hunt for a clean sheet in an erratic fashion and is prone to an overattachment to doomed flops or self-destructive mozzes. With the strict transfer ban on dealings with Will Lafferty expiring, Goé is looking forward to gifting him the Prem title again. Survival is the name of the game.

Politically, Goé is strongly associated with the ‘Hierarchy', although has recently fallen out of favour with many of the old guard. Always on the lookout for some new pawns, he is intimately tied to the expansion agenda and is putting out feelers for a new #justice4algae campaign.

With revenue taking a huge plunge after a disastrous attempt to move to Fantrax, Goé's position as CEO of FatZone is under threat.

I like to keep a strong nucleus in my team but always about for a couple of disposable defenders based on the upcoming fixture list. I am always wary of rotation with squads involved in European competition and routinely reduce players value based on this as no one is ever guaranteed to start.

After a very poor start to the inaugural draft season in early December 2015 I formed a merger with 2 close friends Gavin Ferguson and Calum Langland and have to say there impact was immediate and radical as we went from bottom of the league and won 15 games on the trot with captain Wes Morgan and Robert Huth unable to ever concede a goal and throwing in a brace at the Etihad for good measure. I believe this record winning streak of 15 is yet to be broken to this day.

Unfortunately this all turned sour the following season and we all went separate ways after that. While I still consider these rivals I still maintain the split was purely professional and nothing personal and I continue to keep an eye for my former colleagues results.

Never afraid to ruthlessly drop and sell on my players and have Been known to make a few controversial trades. A particular highlight was causing uproar by giving away Paul Pogba for Mohamed Salah in trade with peckers only for Salah to singlehandedly promote me to the prem. When the stress of the game overwhelmes me I love having a rant to other managers (Daniel Jansepar cops it sometimes) about getting bad rub despite deeps knowing it comes to us all and Is part and parcel.

After early success unfortunately this manager may have become rather stuck in his ways, developing a borderline obsession with owning certain players which are proving detrimental to the club.

After owning him in all previous draft seasons, the manager lives in fear that this could finally be Erik Lamela's breakthrough season and someone else will reap the rewards after years of being nurtured by Louki.

Louki always has an eye out for the next trade and hopes to once again assemble a team of superstars that will propel him back to the top.

The manager has great respect for the sport and always tries to play the game in a fair and honest manner.

We here at the Hierarchy Pawns have always strived to get on well with the other teams in the league and believe we have a good relationship with my fellow managers.

However, everyone needs a rivalry and the Hierarchy Pawns always seem to find themselves locked in battle with Sim City.
Having spent the early years contesting the title both clubs have really struggled to keep their Prem status in recent seasons.
The 2019-20 season looked destined for one of these best of enemies to face the plunge into the dreaded Freak league.
With COVID-19 halting the season there was a chance for the Hierarchy Pawns to bring in some much needed firepower (‘world class' Harry Kane) and managed to pull of the great escape in the dying minutes of the last game of the season. Sim City also survived.

A keen Fantasy manager since the early days of peasant, Lafferty relishes all facets of the beautiful game and clocks up the hours on the training pitch staring absentmindedly at his team into the wee hours to no real benefit. His history includes some highly questionable transfers (Kouyate for Mahrez 2017), error-strewn drafts (Llorente Defoe 1st and 2nd picks 2018) and he has, to his own shame, been known to set 4am alarms in an attempt to secure free list transfer targets when time zones necessitated. Relieved and thrilled to finally secure some silverware this year as was widely reported in the media following boozy final day celebrations.

        A perennial lurker and manager of few words, Ben's draft managerial style is probably best characterised by its relentless pursuit of mediocrity rather than any sort of tangible achievement.

Despite never actually saying anything, Ben is perhaps most notable for unwittingly setting the commitment bar unreasonably high when attending the draft in his second season just minutes after welcoming his newborn daughter home from the hospital for the first time. Hunched over a laptop with wife fizzin, baby screaming, forehead beading and anxiety levels through the roof, any niggling doubts that it had been worth it were swiftly confirmed when Ben's first pick was sidelined for 3 months with knee ligament damage within days of the draft. Ben went on to have a shit season, was relegated after his maiden voyage in the prem, and the rest, as they say, is really boring history.

        The run-in for the 19/20 Covid season was marred with controversy for Ben: beginning with question marks over his commitment and ending with some dubious transfers and active participation in the Freak League SabotageGate™. Discussions with the Board and penning a new deal in an effort to put the issues to bed have left fans underwhelmed, with protests being staged at the club's training ground in the build up to the 20/21 season. Fortunately for Ben, the owner and Chairman doesn't give a fuck what the fans think, and the whole thing is imaginary, so his tenure will continue for the foreseeable future.

FMIN appointed Brown as manager for their inaugural campaign in 2019-20, placing great trust in the 32 year old by offering him a 10 year contract at the club. After a promising start results started to take a turn for the worse and the club spent much of the season languishing in the bottom half of the table. However, FMIN finished the season on a high as Brown took full advantage of the unprecedented lockdown due to COVID-19 and made several high profile opportunistic signings to bolster the squad for the run-in. It wasn't quite enough to secure a top 4 spot in the end, but Brown will certainly be keen to take this momentum into the coming season.

On his squad for the 2020-21 season, Brown stated: "I'm delighted to get fans' favourite Woody [Chris Wood] through the door again this year, as well as add some pace to compliment him up front with Jamie Vardy after an unsuccessful attempt to sign him from AFC Tina last season." He continued: "The Vermin league is notoriously difficult to get out of and is shaping up to be even more competitive this year in its expanded format, not to mention fighting on two fronts this season, so we're hoping to bring in another couple of faces in the coming weeks to help us through the long season ahead."

An elder statesman yet one of the newer additions to the Draft format, Lee Waller cuts the figure of a plump manager with high expectations and in turn high blood pressure. Sibling to Prem manager Adam Waller, waffling is in his bones and due to the nature of his part-time job in ‘music’ he has a lot of time to waffle. If you don’t find Lee chatting shite in The Mill then you’ll likely find him chatting shite in your DMs. A keen trader that enjoys the thrill of the negotiation, Lee is a manager happy to take risks if the price is right. Will likely shoot himself in the foot in the free market if you give him the chance.

A fiercely competitive and moral driven manager, Meskell values the importance of reaching the 'correct' and 'fair' conclusions to the league's most important or trivial issues.

It is key to note that he has always ensured that he has stayed on the positive side of the Moz balance sheet.

A proud Original league member, Meskell volunteered to go be relegated in order to support the revolutionary creation of the Freak league despite two mid-table finishes in the 16 man, one league Draft setup. Shane went on to prove his managerial acumen by securing an instantaneous return to the premier league.

The only blotch on Meskell's record was his relegation from the Premier League in 2018/19 due to his unfortunate punt on Sanchez (8th pick) which turned out to be a very poor choice. The following season, he managed to once again secure an immediate return to the Premier League using his generally 'transfer averse' policy.

One particular bugbear which he believes reduces the reputation of offending teams and their managers is when certain teams change their names on a frequent basis. The London Londoners franchise is steeped in history and become a household name by not dabbling in this curious art.

Meskell has been responsible for recruiting some impressive franchises to the league, including but not limited to; The 'Jugg', Eddie Lyne and Aidan Brown

Historic rivalry was definitely FC Hibak, although the intenseness of this rivalry has decreased in recent seasons due to the clubs plight – Meskell looks forward to the rejuvenation of a fellow household name in order to lock horns in the Premier League again one day.

        Erratic, unpredictable, frantic and inconsistent. Judd is a wheeler dealer by nature and always on the look out for value in the market. This has worked both for an against his team in recent seasons, with an early transfer of De Bruyne to Dani Louki proving pivotal to his eventual crowning as champion and the Doggers relegation to the Freak. The 2019-20 Season did however show the manager's nose for a good deal, with all but 2 players from his original 11 surviving to the end of the season which culminated in a title challenge and promotion to the Prem. Highlights of the season involved trades with Shayan to strip him of his best players, notably Mane. The Bishop's growing disenchantment with the footballing world led to him reviewing the Doggers continued participation in the Draft leagues, however after a period of reflection the manager realised there was little other stimulation in his life. The 2020-21 Season see's the Doggers returns to their rightful place in the Prem, but only time will tell as to whether he can avoid giving Dani Louki his best players.
