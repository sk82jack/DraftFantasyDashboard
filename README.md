# DraftFantasyDashboard

Web front end for tiered draft fantasy football leagues

This dashboard utilises [PowerShell Universal Dashboard](https://universaldashboard.io/).

To start the dashboard run Start.ps1

## Local development and testing

For local development testing you can run `docker-compose up --build` which will build the docker image by copying the local directory into the docker container rather than pulling from GitHub
