A fiercely competitive and moral driven manager, Meskell values the importance of reaching the 'correct' and 'fair' conclusions to the league's most important or trivial issues.

It is key to note that he has always ensured that he has stayed on the positive side of the Moz balance sheet.

A proud Original league member, Meskell volunteered to go be relegated in order to support the revolutionary creation of the Freak league despite two mid-table finishes in the 16 man, one league Draft setup. Shane went on to prove his managerial acumen by securing an instantaneous return to the premier league.

The only blotch on Meskell's record was his relegation from the Premier League in 2018/19 due to his unfortunate punt on Sanchez (8th pick) which turned out to be a very poor choice. The following season, he managed to once again secure an immediate return to the Premier League using his generally 'transfer averse' policy.

One particular bugbear which he believes reduces the reputation of offending teams and their managers is when certain teams change their names on a frequent basis. The London Londoners franchise is steeped in history and become a household name by not dabbling in this curious art.

Meskell has been responsible for recruiting some impressive franchises to the league, including but not limited to; The 'Jugg', Eddie Lyne and Aidan Brown

Generally when a Moz is at stake, rivalries tend to be quite fluid at The London Londoners

Historic rivalry was definitely FC Hibak, although the intenseness of this rivalry has decreased in recent seasons due to the clubs plight – Meskell looks forward to the rejuvenation of a fellow household name in order to lock horns in the Premier League again one day.

A serial fiend, "Goé” first learnt his trade as a teenager in the feudal era of the official Premier League Fantasy Football website, devising and manually processing obscenely complicated head-to-head Champions League and FA Cup tournaments. He fell out of love with the game after a deluge of mediocre performances, with the well-known monotonous churn of the peasant format taking its toll. While in exile in the People's Republic of China, Goé started work on a business plan to bring "draft” fantasy football to the world. Unfortunately, progress stalled after he enlisted future rival manager Dan Barber ("Barbs”) as chief operating officer and Barbs's time in China was mostly wasted chugging unceremoniously on a Vietnamese tobacco pipe. Months later, Goé was amazed to find a new draft website that had put all their ideas into being and it wasn't long before an army of fiends were signed up and the league and the (rumour) mill were formed.
In terms of management style, Goé is known to hunt for a clean sheet in an erratic fashion and grew used to receiving the weekly moz alert from rival Freak Gavin Ferguson last season after a newly brought-in defender lost his clean sheet. Following promotion, Goé looks forward to a season of self-loathing in peace. On the transfer market, he is prone to an overattachment to doomed flops or self-destructive mozzes.
Politically, Goé is strongly associated with the ‘Hierarchy' and the ol' timers movement. Always on the lookout for some new pawns, he is intimately tied to the expansion agenda and has restarted the #justice4plankton campaign for the 2021-22 season.

Erratic, unpredictable, frantic and inconsistent. Judd is a wheeler dealer by nature and always on the look out for value in the market. This has worked both for an against his team in recent seasons, with an early transfer of De Bruyne to Dani Louki proving pivotal to his eventual crowning as champion and the Doggers relegation to the Freak. The 2019-20 Season did however show the manager’s nose for a good deal, with all but 2 players from his original 11 surviving to the end of the season which culminated in a title challenge and promotion to the Prem. Highlights of the season involved trades with Shayan to strip him of his best players, notably Mane. The Bishop’s growing disenchantment with the footballing world led to him reviewing the Doggers continued participation in the Draft leagues, however after a period of reflection the manager realised there was little other stimulation in his life. The 2020-21 Season see’s the Doggers returns to their rightful place in the Prem, but only time will tell as to whether he can avoid giving Dani Louki his best players.

        A perennial lurker and manager of few words, Ben's draft managerial style is probably best characterised by its relentless pursuit of mediocrity rather than any sort of tangible achievement.

Despite never actually saying anything, Ben is perhaps most notable for unwittingly setting the commitment bar unreasonably high when attending the draft in his second season just minutes after welcoming his newborn daughter home from the hospital for the first time. Hunched over a laptop with wife fizzin, baby screaming, forehead beading and anxiety levels through the roof, any niggling doubts that it had been worth it were swiftly confirmed when Ben's first pick was sidelined for 3 months with knee ligament damage within days of the draft. Ben went on to have a shit season, was relegated after his maiden voyage in the prem, and the rest, as they say, is really boring history.

        The run-in for the 19/20 Covid season was marred with controversy for Ben: beginning with question marks over his commitment and ending with some dubious transfers and active participation in the Freak League SabotageGate™. Discussions with the Board and penning a new deal in an effort to put the issues to bed have left fans underwhelmed, with protests being staged at the club's training ground in the build up to the 20/21 season. Fortunately for Ben, the owner and Chairman doesn't give a fuck what the fans think, and the whole thing is imaginary, so his tenure will continue for the foreseeable future.

Panicked and irritable fiend, who is in the top 3% of time spent fiending, but in the bottom 1% for efficiency and decision making. Transfer strategy is down there, with a constant desire to trade and pick up new players for absolutely no reason despite clear and obvious signs that it will be detrimental to the clubs success. Administration has humbled him and a new managerial style to be introduced in the 20/21 season in order to support the clubs restructuring and intended return to the top flight.

I’ve had to take the high road back to management after some unfortunate things were recorded and brought to public attention. Like hardworking, loyal players and believe in integrity above all else. Looking to rebuild my reputation.

AFC ClIMATE CHANGE - Dennis Hollywood: will be interesting to go head to head with a fellow Tim, especially after he took Kieran from me in the draft.

100% German, I’m aiming to do the same as Klopp, conquer this foreign country and one day win the Prem.

Still finding my feet in the game, always eager to learn from past mistakes and happy to not repeat them. Very vocal and hands on, always looking for nice additions on the free list and happy to extend more into trading this season.

FMIN appointed Brown as manager for their inaugural campaign in 2019-20, placing great trust in the 32 year old by offering him a 10 year contract at the club. After a promising start results started to take a turn for the worse and the club spent much of the season languishing in the bottom half of the table. However, FMIN finished the season on a high as Brown took full advantage of the unprecedented lockdown due to COVID-19 and made several high profile opportunistic signings to bolster the squad for the run-in. It wasn't quite enough to secure a top 4 spot in the end, but Brown will certainly be keen to take this momentum into the coming season.

On his squad for the 2020-21 season, Brown stated: “I'm delighted to get fans' favourite Woody [Chris Wood] through the door again this year, as well as add some pace to compliment him up front with Jamie Vardy after an unsuccessful attempt to sign him from AFC Tina last season.” He continued: “The Vermin league is notoriously difficult to get out of and is shaping up to be even more competitive this year in its expanded format, not to mention fighting on two fronts this season, so we're hoping to bring in another couple of faces in the coming weeks to help us through the long season ahead.”
